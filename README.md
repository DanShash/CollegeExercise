## Exercise 1: Pointer Manipulation

### Description

In this exercise, we demonstrate the use of pointers in C++. The function `twice` takes an integer pointer as an argument and doubles the value it points to. The main function initializes an integer, passes its address to the `twice` function, and then prints the modified value.

Exercise #2: Employee Class
Description
This exercise involves creating a class to represent an Employee, with member functions to get and set the employee's first name and monthly salary. Additionally, it includes a main function that creates instances of the Employee class, manipulates their salaries, and prints the new yearly salaries.

Files
Employee.cpp: Contains the implementation of the Employee class methods.
EmployeeX.h: Contains the definition of the Employee class.
MainFunct.cpp: Contains the main function demonstrating the usage of the Employee class.
